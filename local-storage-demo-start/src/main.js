import * as storage from "./storage.js"
let items = ["???!!!"];


// I. declare and implement showItems()
// - this will show the contents of the items array in the <ul>

// II. declare and implement addItem(str)
// - this will add str to the items array (so long as str is length 0 or greater)

// III. declare and implement loadItemsFromLocalStorage()
// - this will load in the favorites array from storage.js

// Also:
// - be sure to update the <ol> as appropriate
// - be sure to update .localStorage by saving items to .localStorage when appropriate (look in storage.js to see where/how to do this)
